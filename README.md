Computer Vision Projects using C++

histogram: 
Compute histogram. The histogram of an image is the statistic counting of pixel values in the input image, where hist[i] tells how many pixels having value i in the input image. Perform binary threshold operation on the input image using the threshold values provide by the user via argv. The binary threshold operation is the simplest way to extract foreground objects in a given grey-scale image.  Given an image and a threshold value, the binary threshold operation is to transform pixels in the input image from grey-scale to binary values. Then display the result of threshold image in a nice visually

3noiseFilters: 
Implement the three image enhancement methods: (1) 3X3 averaging, (2) 3x3 median filter, and (3) 3x3 2D-Gaussian filter.

morphology: 
Implementation of the four basic Morphology Operations: (1) Dilation (2) Erostion (3) Opening (4) Closing.

ConnectedComponent: 
Implement both 4-connected and 8-connected component algorithms.

Thinning: 
The thinning of an object is like peeling off one layer of object from 4 sides (north, south, west, and east) in iterations, until the object becomes a skeleton.

chainCode: 
Chain code for image compression (lossless compression) and object recognition (via) boundary Pattern Analysis.

textLineDetection: 
Document text-line detection and reading direction using Projection Profiles.
